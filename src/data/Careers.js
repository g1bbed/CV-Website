After a failed launch in Feb 2017 the company was cut back to 1 and ½ paid workers and for some-time the staff had to fulfill multiple job roles. After much hard work for close to a year, and new investors Outland Denim now employs close to 15 in Australia and 90 overseas. In October 2018 the Jeans were even worn by the Dutchess Meghan Markle! My employ was official as a Front end developer but it is necessary to say that for the duration of my employ it was a 50% Front End Development and 50% Graphic design. Graphic Design included digital and print. To briefly list, photo editing, web mocks, digital e-books, prints such as flyers and look books. Front end development included coding up final mocks into custom themed web pages using b@se tags for Neto and liquid for Shopify. JS was used when necessary as was JSON elements. This was a very time challenging and enjoyable role."

Throughout my employ, at DesignEasy I could easily say that I created over a five hundred website drafts for new and potential customers. My role included: customer contact, mockup, drafting, and lastly coding the customer website into Open Cart or Wordpress."
